(RAVDESS)
The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song
(RAVDESS) contains 7356 files (total size: 24.8 GB). The database
contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two
lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent.
Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust
expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful
emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional
intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. All
conditions are available in three modality formats: Audio-only (16bit,
48kHz .wav), Audio-Video (720p H.264, AAC 48kHz, .mp4), and
Video-only (no sound). Note, there are no song files for Actor_18.
